# Shopping Tracker

This project is being developed in Android Studio by Paul Stanek as the final project for CIS-245 at Rock Valley College, Spring 2018.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this application is anyone who wants to use an electronic shopping list that saves purchase history.

## Current Features

This application allows the user to create a shopping list, and will track purchase history for each item.  This includes when it was purchased, the quanity, and the cost per unit.

Data is saved to a local SQLite database, rather than an online database such as Firebase.  This was done intentionally, as the app must potentially function in stores that may not have WiFi or phone reception.

## Possible Additional Features

In future updates, I would like to include the ability to save multiple lists, remove line items from purchase history (in case data was entered incorrectly, for example), and track purchases by store.  I would also like to implement a quick-add function to allow a user to add items from their history directly to their current list.
